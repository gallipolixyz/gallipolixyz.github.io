What started as a modest effort among a few like-minded individuals quickly grew beyond our expectations. Within its first days, **Gallipoli** attracted over 250 passionate members eager to dive into the world of cybersecurity.

Our vision is simple yet profound: to create an environment where cybersecurity enthusiasts can learn from each other's experiences without fear of judgment. Here, mistakes are not setbacks but stepping stones to growth. By fostering an open and supportive culture, we believe that individuals can achieve more together than they ever could alone.

As we prepare to open our doors to all enthusiasts, we prioritize those who joined us initially out of pure passion for cybersecurity. Their dedication forms the bedrock of our community.
